FSharpening
===========

Want to start learning F# hands on? Try this no-friction, no-download guide!

There are lots of ways to learn F#. You could buy books and install Visual Studio. All of this is documented at [http://fsharp.org](http://fsharp.org).

# Bootstrapping: No download necessary

* To just start trying F# right now, go to [http://tryfsharp.org](http://tryfsharp.org)
* To get a more detailed grounding in functional concepts, motivations, and side-by-side comparisons with C#, couple that with reading [F# For Fun and Profit](http://www.fsharpforfunandprofit.org)

# Internal resources for V1ers

This repo was started by employees at [VersionOne](http://github.com/VersionOne), which uses the F# language in several product components. If you're on the inside, check out the Structured Query project in the Core product, and [this page on confluence to download [F# for C# Developers](http://confluence/display/dev/F%23+for+V1+C%23+users) for free.

# Longer-term

The FSharp.org site is a great place to go, no doubt. As are the numerous books about the language.

Check out the F# dojos and other resources at [http://c4fsharp.net/](http://c4fsharp.net/). Also follow them at [https://twitter.com/c4fsharp](https://twitter.com/c4fsharp)

# Free video introductions

* Dr. Don Syme's C9 Lectures: [Introduction to F#, Parts 1 - 3](http://channel9.msdn.com/Series/C9-Lectures-Dr-Don-Syme-Introduction-to-F-) -- I highly recommend these videos to hear the language's inventor describe it in detail.
* [Understanding the World with F#](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Understanding-the-World-with-F), by Tomas Petricek: *The F# Software Foundation has been working hard to make F# the best tool for doing data science, not just on the .NET and Mono platforms. This video shows the recently announced F# libraries for interactive data analysis, for accessing data from a variety of sources including REST based services, CSV files and online data sources like WorldBank and Freebase.*

# Recommended Books

* [Expert F#](http://www.amazon.com/Expert-3-0-Experts-Voice-Syme/dp/1430246502/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1408372118&sr=1-4&keywords=f%23), by Don Syme. Don invented the language and you can find lots of videos about it from him in Channel 9. This books is excellent as a follow-on from the TryFSharp web site.
* [Real-World Functional Programming with Examples in F# and C#](http://www.amazon.com/Real-World-Functional-Programming-Tomas-Petricek/dp/1933988924/ref=sr_1_5?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1408372118&sr=1-5&keywords=f%23), by Tomas Petricek. This book is also excellent, but it's more theoretical, and is more intense toward the middle to end chapters.
* [The Book of F#](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Breaking-Managed-Functional-Programming/dp/1593275528/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1408372118&sr=1-1&keywords=f%23), by Dave Francher. I have not read too far into this book, but it seems to be a good intro to the language.
* [More!](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=f%23) There are quite a few books out now! Everything from [F# for Scientists](http://www.amazon.com/F-Scientists-Jon-Harrop/dp/0470242116/ref=sr_1_12?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1408372118&sr=1-12&keywords=f%23) to [F# for Quantitative Finance](http://www.amazon.com/F-Quantitative-Finance-Johan-Astborg/dp/1782164626/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1408372118&sr=1-8&keywords=f%23).
